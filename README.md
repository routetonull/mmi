# mmi

This was my first attempt to automate myself out of my job. Year is 2003.

I was assigned the task of monitoring the IP addressing of the alarm centers of a bank to make sure that there were no errors.

The guy before me spent hours every day reading IP addresses form a sheet and pinging from a console, filling a daily report with the results. He then taught me how to do the same when he moved to another project.

I spent two days learning Perl and HTML, just enough to automate the task and use my well deserved spare time to prepare my CCNA.

At the end of the project the PM was happy, there were no errors and I finished within the assigned time frame.

I got my CCNA and moved to do a position as a junior network engineer ;-)

I put the code here as a personal reminder. Learning is a lifetime process. You never know when the skills will be used but better be prepared when the chance arrives.

Keep studying and join the dots!
